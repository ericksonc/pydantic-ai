I want you to help me design a canonical JSON representation of a "conversation" - actually we will call it a "thread"- a term which we'll treat as inclusive of "conversation" while not requiring it look like what we'd consider a conversation, but which consists of a sequential stream of user + agent "actions." For now, let's call it "ThreadProtocol."

This will both directly relate to Pydantic AI, but also be inclusive of many things outside of Pydantic AI's "scope"

Which is to say- that for a given JSON ThreadProtocol file we can deterministically generate the list of Pydantic AI ModelMessages that should be passed to the Pydantic AI agent.

However- this will involve certain specific transformations of those messages- and, it'll also include some information that's outside the scope of what should be translated to ModelMessages. (example: "granted access to tool X to agent Y" - that's not something that would get translated to a ModelMessage. That's something that *my system* would have to interpret, and then cause that tool to be granted to agent Y from that turn forward.

In other words- this format should be *inclusive* of everything related to the question of "how do I serialize / deserialize a list of ModelMessages to and from JSON" - but it must also include other things too.

Here are the main *differences* between just the "Vanilla Pydantic AI message serialization / deserialization."

A lot of these stem from the idea that this will be used for my own multi agent system. This means that while "which agent" isn't a primitive of Pydantic AI, it is a primitive of my system. So, just imagine there's a "group chat" between a user and *two* agents, A and B- When agent A sees conversation history, it must be able to distinguish what "it" (A) said, vs what "the other agent" (B) said.

We'll do this simply by prepending text to the text of the ModelMessage when we feed it in as conversation history.

If the agent named "Fred" outputs text "I like football"

Then in future turns, the text of that message *within the ModelMessage TextPart* be "{agent:Fred}: I like football"

Whereas in our canonical JSON representation - where we have control over the schema, and it's that schema you and I are designing now- it'll probably just be something like agent_id: UUID, agent_name:str 

We'll make frequent use of UUID, I think. 

The "thread" will have its own UUID.

I don't think we need UUID for messages at this time. 

Note, of course, that the question of "how is tool use reflected to agents other than the one that used the tool" is, really, a non-trivial question. However, in terms of the ThreadProtocol JSON itself, we don't need to address that- we just need to record which agent used the tool; how that gets represented to agents other than "the agent that used the tool" can be left to the interpretation layer.

Okay- are you clear on the general *idea* of what I'm looking for in terms of defining ThreadProtocol?

What are the main unanswered questions you have that must be resolved before we actually write the protocol definition?

Before you answer- make sure you're quite familiar with the ModelMessage schema so your understanding of that side of things is rock solid.
